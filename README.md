### CaveatEmptor - Auction management system
* This application was created as a learning exercise of JPA-Hibernate
* This application provides services to put an item in auction by a seller, placing bids for the item by buyers, then finally closing the deal based on the business rules. This aids in creation of accounts by seller as well as buyers, creation of items and their detailed information, finally the creation of bids.
* Currently this contains only tests written in TestNG
